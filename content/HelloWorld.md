Hello there,

Welcome to my blog. I'm so excited to have finally launched this.
I've been working on my personal blog for quite sometime and this is the 15th variation of my personal blog.
I've tried out tools such as:

- GatsbyJS
- NextJS
- NuxtJS
- Ghost
- Hugo
- Django
e.t.c

I was basically playing around with most of this tools as I didn't have a fixed idea on what I wanted yet.
Anyways that's over now as I have finally launched my blog.

It's based on [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html) which is a Python static site generator.
I fondly call my implementation **PAMSTACK**, a sibling of the popular **JAMSTACK** that makes use of Javascript.

I'll be sharing a lot of my learnings here. **Backticks & Tildes** will still house a lot of my tutorials until I figure out what to do with it. Feel free to check out my **VLOG** :), I'll be creating videos of learnings I don't have the urge to write about [here](http://vlog.bolaji.de) - vlog[dot]bolaji[dot]de
